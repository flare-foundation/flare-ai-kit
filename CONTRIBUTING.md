# Contributing to Flare AI Kit

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Flare AI Kit!

We welcome contributions from the community to help make this SDK robust, feature-rich, and easy to use.

## How to Contribute

1. Search existing issues/PRs to avoid duplicates.
2. For opening an issue, use labels `bug`, `feature`, `docs`, or `question`.
3. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Implement, test, then submit a PR referencing the issue.

## âœ¨ Write High-Quality Code

We strive for high-quality, maintainable code. Please adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Clean Interfaces & Simplicity:**

    - Follow the Zen of Python principle: "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
    - Design clear, minimal, and predictable interfaces for functions and classes.
    - Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
    - Keep code focused and avoid unnecessary complexity.
    - Use [Google-style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings) docstrings.

2.  **Use dependencies sparingly:**

    - Every dependency added is a potential security risk.
    - If the dependency is required, it should live in under `[project.optional-dependencies]` with a key marking the high level function, e.g. `rag`, `consensus`.

3.  **Formatting, Linting & Type-Checking:**

    - Use [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for formatting and linting, both settings are defined in `pyproject.toml`.
    - Use [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) for type checking, all new code MUST include accurate type hints. Avoid using `typing.Any` unless absolutely necessary and clearly justified in comments.
    - You can also install [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) into VSCode for an easier experience.
    - Ensure your code passes all checks locally without errors:
      ```bash
      uv run ruff format
      uv run ruff check --fix
      uv run pyright
      ```

4.  **Test Extensively:**

    - New features **must** include appropriate unit and/or integration tests using `pytest`.
    - Bug fixes **should** include tests demonstrating the fix.
    - **All tests must pass** locally before submitting a pull request. Run tests via:
      ```bash
      uv run pytest tests/unit/your-test.py -v
      uv run pytest tests/integration/your-test.py -v
      ```

5.  **Use Conventional Commits:**

    - All commit messages **must** adhere to the **Conventional Commits** specification. This helps automate changelog generation and provides a clear commit history.
    - Read the spec: [https://www.conventionalcommits.org/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
    - **Format:** `<type>[optional scope]: <description>`
    - **Examples:**
      - `feat(rag): add support for Neo4j AuraDB connection`
      - `fix(ecosystem): correct decimal calculation in FTSO price feed`
      - `docs(readme): update README with installation instructions`
      - `test(rag): add unit tests for GraphDbSettingsModel`
      - `chore(deps): update ruff version in pyproject.toml`
